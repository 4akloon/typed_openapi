# typed_openapi

OpenAPI 3.x → Dart client generator for imperfect, code-first specs.

> **Status:** early design, not published yet.

- Input: local OpenAPI 3.0 / 3.1 file (JSON or YAML).
- Output: ready-to-use Dart code on Dio, no `build_runner` step.
- Models follow the `json_serializable` contract (`fromJson` / `toJson`).
- Spec defects are fixed by named normalizer rules and reported as diagnostics
  with stable codes; anything ambiguous is reported with a suggested override.

## Usage

Describe each client in `typed_openapi.yaml` next to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  preset: nestjs          # normalizer preset; also: generic, fastapi, springdoc, aspnet
clients:
  core_api:
    input: specs/core_api.json      # local JSON or YAML snapshot
    output: lib/src/api/core_api    # each client gets its own directory
```

Check the specs without generating anything:

```sh
dart run typed_openapi check            # all clients
dart run typed_openapi check core_api   # one client
dart run typed_openapi check --format json
```

Every finding has a stable code (`TOA011`), a JSON pointer into the spec and,
for files the parser could position, a line and column. Exit code `1` means
at least one error, `78` means the config could not be read.

Generated clients depend on
[`typed_openapi_runtime`](../typed_openapi_runtime/README.md).
